## RAG Chatbot Security Considerations

This document outlines the security considerations for the RAG chatbot system. Given the sensitive nature of medical information, security is paramount.

**1. Data Encryption:**

*   **Data at Rest:** All sensitive data (user queries, retrieved documents, etc.) must be encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
*   **Data in Transit:** All communication between components must be encrypted using TLS/SSL.

**2. Authentication and Authorization:**

*   **User Authentication:** Implement robust user authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) to verify user identities.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality based on user roles.
*   **API Key Management:** Securely manage API keys used to access external services.

**3. Input Validation and Sanitization:**

*   **Prevent Injection Attacks:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, prompt injection).
*   **Limit Input Length:** Limit the length of user inputs to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

**4. LLM Security:**

*   **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully engineer prompts to minimize the risk of generating harmful or biased responses.
*   **Output Filtering:** Implement output filtering to remove potentially harmful or sensitive information from the generated responses.
*   **Model Monitoring:** Monitor the LLM's behavior for signs of malicious activity.

**5. Data Privacy:**

*   **Compliance with Regulations:** Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
*   **Data Minimization:** Collect only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide the service.
*   **Data Anonymization:** Anonymize or pseudonymize sensitive data whenever possible.

**6. Auditing and Logging:**

*   **Comprehensive Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to track all user activity and system events.
*   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.

**7. Tool Security:**

*   **Secure Tool Integration:** Ensure that all integrated tools are secure and do not introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant tools only the minimum necessary permissions.
